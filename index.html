      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m an ambitious and curious person who loves learning new things and taking on challenges. 
        I’m particularly interested in how data, machine learning, and AI can be used to solve real-world problems. 
        I’m eager to find new opportunities in these fields and continue developing my skills.
      </p>

      <h3>Studies</h3>
      <p>
        I am a first-year master’s student at Aalto University, majoring in Machine Learning, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence.
        I have a background in bioinformation technology and computer science, and I completed my bachelor’s degree in spring 2025 with honors (GPA 4.2/5.0).
      </p>

      <h3>Work life</h3>
      <p>
        In autumn 2025, I am working as a Software Specialist at the Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke) and as a Teaching Assistant at Aalto University.
        At Luke, I develop full-stack applications and apply open-source software to support the Statistics Production team.
        At Aalto, I assist in teaching Machine Learning and Basic Python Programming courses.
        I enjoy my current work, but in 2026 I’m looking for new opportunities in data science, machine learning, or AI-related roles.
      </p>

      <h3>Hobbies and interests</h3>
      <p>
        I believe having hobbies alongside work and studies is important for maintaining a balanced life.
        I enjoy learning new skills through my hobbies, but I don’t take them too seriously.
        I like outdoor activities such as hiking, golf, and skiing, as well as CrossFit and ball games like badminton and tennis.
        I also work occasionally as a CrossFit coach, which feels like a hobby to me.
      </p>

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/oonas21/Online-education-ML-project">Machine learning project for predicting online education outcomes</a> – 
        I am particularly interested in which factors influence online education outcomes, as COVID-19 placed my generation in online learning.
        This was one of my first machine learning projects, where I trained several different models from <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a> to predict online education outcomes.
        I compared the models to see how well they performed in the classification task.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/oonas21/Education-Employment-Economy-visualization">Education, employment and economy visualization project</a> – 
        Interactive visualization project exploring how European education, employment, and the economy relate to each other.
        The data was obtained from <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/sdi/database">Eurostat Sustainable Development Goals</a>, 
        and the visualizations were created using <a href="https://plotly.com/">Plotly</a>.</li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/oonas21/Social-media-stress-detection">ML project for stress detection based on Reddit and Twitter posts</a> – 
          I am currently working on this project. It is a machine learning project where I apply and practice natural language processing. 
          I compare different machine learning models for stress detection and explore key findings from the text data. 
          This is a very interesting topic in the era of social media.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/oonas21/Data-Visualization-Library">Data visualization library</a> 
           – This was my very first computer science project. 
          I designed it with <a href="https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/">PyQt6</a>, and while the code is quite low-level, it taught me a lot about building applications from scratch.</li>
        <li><a href="https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/items/14662971-f8e0-402d-b3b6-4e4ee03b7d12">Bachelor's thesis</a> – The topic of my thesis was Contrastive Learning for Molecular Property Prediction Tasks.
          The thesis taught me about different deep learning models and how they are applied to real-world problems. 
          It received a grade of 5/5.</li>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m an ambitious and curious person who loves learning new things and taking on challenges. 
        I’m particularly interested in how data, machine learning, and AI can be used to solve real-world problems. 
        I’m eager to find new opportunities in these fields and continue developing my skills.
      </p>

      <h3>Studies</h3>
      <p>
        I am a first-year master’s student at Aalto University, majoring in Machine Learning, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence.
        I have a background in bioinformation technology and computer science, and I completed my bachelor’s degree in spring 2025 with honors (GPA 4.2/5.0).
      </p>

      <h3>Work life</h3>
      <p>
        In autumn 2025, I am working as a Software Specialist at the Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke) and as a Teaching Assistant at Aalto University.
        At Luke, I develop full-stack applications and apply open-source software to support the Statistics Production team.
        At Aalto, I assist in teaching Machine Learning and Basic Python Programming courses.
        I enjoy my current work, but in 2026 I’m looking for new opportunities in data science, machine learning, or AI-related roles.
      </p>

      <h3>Hobbies and interests</h3>
      <p>
        I believe having hobbies alongside work and studies is important for maintaining a balanced life.
        I enjoy learning new skills through my hobbies, but I don’t take them too seriously.
        I like outdoor activities such as hiking, golf, and skiing, as well as CrossFit and ball games like badminton and tennis.
        I also work occasionally as a CrossFit coach, which feels like a hobby to me.
      </p>

          This was my very first computer science project. 
          I designed it with PyQt6, and while the code is quite low-level, it taught me a lot about building applications from scratch.</li>
